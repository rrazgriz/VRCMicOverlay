# VRCMicOverlay

OpenVR Overlay for a custom microphone icon for VRChat.

## Usage

Run program with SteamVR open. Optionally: edit the generated `settings.json` to your liking, and restart.

## Issues

- Program will fail to init if given invalid or nonexistent files for images/sounds.
- Icon will probably not point at head when positioned at different angles.
